## Remote Control Project

### Week 1 Homework For Skill Distillery

#### Overview
In this project, we made a program that would simulate the functions of a remote
control. The program starts by asking you "To begin, please turn on the remote
control: ". The user inputs on. The system prints "Turning ON.....". The program
asks the user to "Please input a number between 0 through 9: ". If the user inputs
a number 0-9, the program will respond with "BOOP!", then ask the user to input a
number 0 through 9 again. If the user inputs something besides 0 through 9, the
program will respond "Command Not Recognized". If the user inputs "off" the
computer will respond "Turning off", and end the program will end.
